# BusinessLoans
A project of mine that employs logistic regression, lasso regression, random forest, and majority class classifier to make several models that use the same variables to see which model best predicts which businesses will pay off a loan.

Requires SBAnational.csv dataset. I would upload it to Github but it is too big.
