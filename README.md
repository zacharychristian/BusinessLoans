# BusinessLoans
A project of mine that employs logistic regression, lasso regression, random forest, and majority class classifier to make several models that use the same variables to see which model best predicts which businesses will pay off a loan. The logic used in performing these models is the same for most of them; regular Python logic. The logic for Random Forest employs pipeline logic, code that can be reused for other projects and is more general use than regular python code. This project utilized Jupyter Notebook.

Requires SBAnational.csv dataset. I would upload it to Github but it is too big.
